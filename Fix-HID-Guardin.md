# How to fix x360ce HID Guardian not working

Sometimes, `HID Guardian` included in `x360ce` doesn't work. For example, you can have a controller well connected but your game detects two controllers. Follow this document to fix the problem.

## 1. Download and install HidHide (need reboot)
Option 1. From official repo: https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide/releases
Option 2. From this repo (I downloaded v1.5.212)

## 2. Launch and configure HidHide program

2.1) First tab: specify path to your `x360ce.exe` from which you dont's want controllers to be hidden

2.2) Second tab: select controller(s) you want to hide from all other apps (Steam, ...)

## 3. Check the box "*Enable device hiding*"

## 4. Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
